Most color vision deficiency simulators that are browser extensions don't properly function when viewing a PDF directly in the browser.

I needed a quick way to load all my slides from a presentation to verify they would be easily readable for anyone in the audience with a color vision deficiency, and this was the first solution I came up with.

Uses the [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) platform, created by Mozilla, to render the PDFs.
